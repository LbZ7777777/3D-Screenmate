# 3D-Screenmate
3D Screenmate Video Game made in Godot Engine for ECE 1895 Junior Design

# Design Overview
The program intends to build an interesting desktop widget to alleviate boredom. Ideally, it would also have functional elements, such as an AI chatbot, desk-break timers, etc. Unfortunately, the current state of this project is barebones due to time constraints.

Originally, the design was to include significant personality in the screenmates, as well as a complex environment for interactions.

Instead, the final project managed to accomplish the most barebones of requirements to qualify as a screenmate program, and even those barebone requirements are achieved at a sketchy level.

Given my inability to achieve the desired vision within a time frame somewhat diminished by procrastinated and underestimated senior design and junior design Bop-it projects, a full six week development period would likely have been more fleshed out but still unable to fully accomplish my initial objectives.

# Preliminary Design Verification
The screenmate program was developed in parts.
