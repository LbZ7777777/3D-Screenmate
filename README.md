# 3D-Screenmate
3D Screenmate Video Game made in Godot Engine for ECE 1895 Junior Design

# Design Overview
The program intends to build an interesting desktop widget to alleviate boredom. Ideally, it would also have functional elements, such as an AI chatbot, desk-break timers, etc. Unfortunately, the current state of this project is barebones due to time constraints.

Originally, the design was to include significant personality in the screenmates, as well as a complex environment for interactions.

Instead, the final project managed to accomplish the most barebones of requirements to qualify as a screenmate program, and even those barebone requirements are achieved at a sketchy level.

Given my inability to achieve the desired vision within a time frame somewhat diminished by procrastinated and underestimated senior design and junior design Bop-it projects, a full six week development period would likely have been more fleshed out but still unable to fully accomplish my initial objectives.

# Preliminary Design Verification
## Multiple Windows
The screenmate program was developed in parts. First, early portions of a tutorial on using multiple windows in Godot was trialed.

Unfortunately, my decision to temporize full testing of the multiple windows system, especially with regards to my initially 3D workspace, meant this section's early design verification failed to catch the litany of issues I would later have with the windows.

## Animation
After the multiple windows tutorial, I attempted to follow an outdated tutorial on animating a Skeleton3D Godot node.
